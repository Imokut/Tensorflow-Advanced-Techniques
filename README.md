# tensorflow-advanced-techniques
My work on [TensorFlow Advanced Techniques specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-advanced-techniques) from DeepLearning.AI

There are four courses in this specialization, hence, four directories in this repo for each course
- [Custom Models, Layers and Loss Functions with TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/custom-models-layers-loss-functions-with-tensorflow?specialization=tensorflow-advanced-techniques)
- [Custom and Distributed Training with TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/custom-distributed-training-with-tensorflow?specialization=tensorflow-advanced-techniques)
- [Advanced Computer Vision with TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-computer-vision-with-tensorflow?specialization=tensorflow-advanced-techniques)
- [Generative Deep Learning with TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-deep-learning-with-tensorflow?specialization=tensorflow-advanced-techniques)

This repo includes all the labs and assignments on the course of getting this certification
