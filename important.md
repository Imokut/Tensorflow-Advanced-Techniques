This states important concepts in my notebooks

# <a href="Course 1 - Custom Models, Layers and Loss Functions\Week 1 - Functional API\Labs\C1_W1_Lab_3_siamese-network.ipynb">Siamese Network</a>

This siamese network outputs two vectors and compares their euclidian distance. By this method, I compare the similiarity and dissimilarity between pairs of images of fashion items. The Fashion Mnist Dataset is used here. 


# Confusion Matrix

The following notebooks contain code with confusion matrices. This is my preferred evaluation technique for classification problems.
-  <a href="Course 1 - Custom Models, Layers and Loss Functions\Week 1 - Functional API\W1_Assignment\C1W1_Assignment.ipynb">Code 1</a>
-  <a href="Course 2 - Custom Training loops, Gradients and Distributed Training\Week 2 - Simple Custom Training\Assignment\C2W2_Assignment.ipynb"> Code 2</a>

# Image Models with helpful image visualization functions

- <a href="Course 1 - Custom Models, Layers and Loss Functions\Week 1 - Functional API\Labs\C1_W1_Lab_3_siamese-network.ipynb">Pairs of Images and their euclidean distance</a>
- <a href="Course 2 - Custom Training loops, Gradients and Distributed Training\Week 2 - Simple Custom Training\Labs\C2_W2_Lab_2_training-categorical.ipynb">Image, Correct Label, Predicted Label</a>

# My Model Implementations
